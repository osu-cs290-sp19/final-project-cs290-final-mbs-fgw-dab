Hello Github!

Update 28 May:
Added basic html file. Overall layout is similar to tweeter and hopefully somewhat understandable. The questions are similar to twits except they have reply sub-articles that can be added. Things to do with javascript:
-toggle 'hidden' on windowbg and windowmain in the questionwindow, createwindow, and loginwindow articles when the ask, create account, and login buttons are pushed, respectively
-toggle 'hidden' when the cancel button on any of the above windows is pushed
-add login/create account functionality for the appropriate buttons (let me know how I can help with this)
-filter questions with searchbar
-add ability to add new questions to main
-add ability to append replies to question articles
-more stuff I'm forgetting
Things for me to do:
-hide items with hidden flag
-add a tag system
-css! (make it look not hideous)
-show that you're logged in
-answer any questions you all have about the html
-more stuff I'm forgetting
